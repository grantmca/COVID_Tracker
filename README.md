Covid Tracker


## Setup

The first thing to do is to clone the repository:

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/grantmca/COVID_Tracker.git
$ cd COVID_Tracker
```


Then install the dependencies:

```sh
(env)$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
Note the `(env)` in front of the prompt. This indicates that this terminal
session operates in a virtual environment set up by `virtualenv2`.

Once `pip` has finished downloading the dependencies:
```sh
(env)$ python manage.py runserver
```
